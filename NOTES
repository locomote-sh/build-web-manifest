make-html-header:
    - probably called by a heckle extension
    - depends on manifest loading functions
    - depends on list of app icon & splashscreen sizes

make-web-manifest:
    - called at build time as a workflow action
    - depends on manifest loading functions
    - queries for list of available app images, extracts list of icons

make-sw:
    - called at build time as a workflow action
    - depends on manifest loading functions

manifest loading functions:
    - depends on json+links
    - provides a default manifest definition

Q: Do all of the above belong in the same repo?
> Probably yes, although possible manifest loading needs to be shared with locomote-core.
